Implementation of JS array in C (for fun).

Since C doesn't support optional arguments or function overloading I couldn't implement some methods the same way they are done in JS (for example "slice" or "splice").

This was a really good small project to fully understand pointers, pointers on pointers, memory allocation and some other C aspects.

**Implemented methods:**
- new_array
- array_foreach
- array_filter
- array_find
- array_map
- array_push
- array_pop
- array_shift
- array_unshift
- array_sort
- array_slice
- array_splice
